# Ebuddy Fullstack Assessment

This project is a fullstack application built using a Turbo monorepo structure. It includes a frontend built with Next.js and a backend implemented using Firebase Functions. Firestore is used as the database, and Firebase Emulator is used for local development and testing.

## Project Structure
As in the example document Technical Test, but only I wrap it in /src/ directory.

## Requirement
- Node.js ^22
- Firebase installed in your environment

## How to run this project
`npm run build`
The firebase emulators will start with the front end, just point your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

## Notes
I dont create Signup Page, so tester need to go to Firebase UI and add user manually at the Authentication feature and login.
